# Business Analyst and System Analyst Assignment

## Task

Create a **Sequence Diagram** to describe a project or task you have previously worked on that involved **ISO 20022 messages**, starting from the **originating system (e.g., Member Bank Channel)** all the way to the **Bank of Thailand (BOT)** or **SWIFT Gateway**.

You may choose to illustrate either:

- **Outward flows**, such as `pacs.008`, `pacs.009`  
- **Inward flows**, such as `camt.054` (credit/debit notification), or `camt.053` (statement)

Please design the diagram **based on your understanding and experience**, selecting the most appropriate flow to demonstrate.

You may use any tool you are comfortable with to create the Sequence Diagram.  
*(If you are able to write it using PlantUML, it will be given special consideration.)*
